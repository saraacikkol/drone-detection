# Evaluating YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv11: Performance in Drone Object Detection
This README file outlines the steps and details to compare the performance of Yolov5, Yolov8, Yolov9 and Yolov11 to establish clear understanding of which model configurations deliver the best results within the Yolo family.

# Drone Detection Dataset

To support the development and evaluation of drone detection models, we present a comprehensive dataset specifically curated for this purpose. The dataset is sourced from the publicly available Drone Object Detection Dataset on Roboflow and contains annotated images captured in diverse environmental conditions and camera perspectives.

This dataset is designed to enable robust detection and classification of drones and other common flying objects.

Dataset Features:

a. Classes: Drones, Helicopters, Birds, and Airplanes

b. Annotations: Includes bounding boxes and labels in YOLO format

c. Diverse Conditions: Images taken under various environmental conditions and from different camera angles
